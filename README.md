# Description

This is a basic decentralized exchange I build for the Etheruem 201 Smart Contract programming course I completed in the Moralis Academy ( previously the Ivan on Tech Academy)

It only contains 2 tokens: ETH and LINK as this is more of a learning example.

More coins can be added and this can also be deployed on the testnet.

## Future Development

I hope to build a front end for this and deploy it to the Ropsten Testnet
