# Description

  This is a basic decentralized exchange I build for the Etheruem 201 Smart Contract programming course 
  I completed in the Moralis Academy ( previously the Ivan on Tech Academy)
  
  It only contains 2 tokens: ETH and LINK as this is more of a learning example. 
  
  More coins can be added and this can also be deployed on the testnet.
